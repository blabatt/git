%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Hooks}
\textbf{Client Side} Pre and post- events like commit, push, etc, git can run script in .git/hooks/ directory.  These are excluded from version control.
\textbf{Server Side} Similar to client side, but are included in pushes, and used to implement controlled team processes.
\textbf{GitHub} Upon <event> (often a push), GitHub emits an HTTP post to indicated url.  The server listening there can parse, interpret \& act according to arbitrary logic.
